# Color-Detection-AI

Noah Trinite

A simple Computer Vision program that can detect specified colors.
Objects of specified colors can then be used to draw on the screen.

Colors are found using a color picker script. Objects are held in front of camera and then sliders are adjusted so only the wanted object is in the window.
The values from each slider represent the HSV values of the color and can be added to the "colors" array in DrawingAI.py
