# Color-Detection-AI

Final Project <br />
Noah Trinite <br />

A simple Computer Vision program that can detect specified colors. <br />
Objects of specified colors can then be used to draw on the screen. <br />
 
Colors are found using a color picker script. Objects are held in front of camera and then sliders are adjusted so only the wanted object is in the window. <br />
The values from each slider represent the HSV values of the color and can be added to the "colors" array in DrawingAI.py <br />
